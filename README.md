<h1>Brute-force Password Guesser</h1>
This is a simple brute-force password guesser that iterates through all possible combinations of characters within a given range of lengths to find the target password.

<h2>Installation</h2>
No installation is required, simply download the script and run it in your preferred Python environment.

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the password guesser, run the script and follow the instructions provided in the command line interface. You will be prompted to enter the target password and the maximum length to guess (up to 6 for reasonable runtimes).

<h2>How it works</h2>
The script uses the itertools module to generate all possible combinations of characters within a given length range. It then checks each combination against the target password until it finds a match.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used to gain unauthorised access to any system or account. The use of brute-force attacks to obtain passwords is illegal and unethical.
